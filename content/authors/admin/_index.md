I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. 

I am an applied microeconomist working in development, labor, and political economy. Recent areas of research include how infrastructure affects informality, the role of automation in reducing occupational segregation in the US, and the effects of the disclosure of corruption cases on citizens' compliance with the law.
