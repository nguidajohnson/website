abstract: In this paper, I empirically analyze the effect of the disclosure of
  corruption cases on citizens’ compliance with the law. To do so, I use data on
  corruption cases generated by the Brazilian anti-corruption plan, “Programa de
  Fiscalização em Entes Federativos”, which randomly audits municipalities for
  their use of federal funds. I measure non-compliance with the law by citizens
  using data on traffic offenses at the municipality level. The random selection
  of municipalities to be audited provides me with a straightforward empirical
  strategy. My main results indicate that the disclosure of corruption cases at
  the municipality level increases per capita traffic offenses by 1.2% and an
  additional case of corruption disclosed increases traffic offenses per capita
  by 0.4%. These estimates are small and not statistically different from zero.
  Therefore, I am not able to conclude that the disclosure of corruption has an
  impact on compliance with the law by citizens.
