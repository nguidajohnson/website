abstract: In this paper, I empirically analyze the effect of the disclosure of
  corruption cases on citizens’ compliance with the law. To do so, I use data on
  corruption cases generated by the Brazilian anti-corruption plan, “Programa de
  Fiscalização em Entes Federativos,” which audits municipalities for their use
  of federal funds. The random selection of municipalities to be audited
  provides a straightforward empirical strategy. I measure non-compliance with
  the law by citizens using data on traffic offenses at the municipal level. My
  main results indicate that the disclosure of corruption cases at the municipal
  level increases per capita traffic offenses by 1.2% and an additional case of
  corruption disclosed increases traffic offenses per capita by 0.4%. These
  estimates are small and not statistically different from zero. Therefore, I
  cannot conclude that the disclosure of corruption impacts citizens' compliance
  with the law.
