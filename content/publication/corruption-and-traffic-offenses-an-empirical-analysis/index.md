abstract: Do revelations of corruption lead to an increase in traffic offenses?
  To address this question, I leverage Brazil's anti-corruption program,
  Programa de Fiscalização em Entes Federativos por Sorteios Públicos, which
  exposed municipal-level corruption cases, to examine their potential impact on
  citizens' compliance with traffic laws. Using data on traffic offenses, I find
  that corruption has no effect on traffic violations. This finding remains
  consistent regardless of the severity of corruption cases, the age of drivers,
  the availability of local media, or whether corrupt politicians were legally
  punished or reelected. These results suggest that adherence to traffic rules
  is more likely driven by individual risk preferences and broader social and
  cultural factors rather than by political corruption.
