  We examine the contribution of automation to occupational gender segregation
  and to the gender gap in college education. First, we document that women were
  more likely to be displaced by automation. Then, exploiting cross-commuting
  zone variation in the risk of automation, we show that women were much more
  likely than men to transition out of routine task intensive occupations to
  occupations requiring higher levels of skill, for a given shock in the risk of
  automation. Local labor markets that were more affected by automation
  experienced greater occupational integration by gender. Potential mechanisms
  are the growing demand for social skills that favor women and their greater
  ability to upskill. Consistent with these mechanisms, we find that local labor
  markets more susceptible to automation saw larger increases in the share of
  young women completing college relative to men and a greater movement of women
  into occupations with high math and high social skill requirements.
