abstract: I study the effects of improvements in transportation infrastructure
  on informality. To deal with endogeneity issues, I implement two complementary
  identification strategies. First, taking advantage of the staggered rollout of
  highways, I apply a generalized difference-in-difference regression model.
  Second, I conduct an instrumental variable strategy by exploiting the fact
  that municipalities along the route of important cities in Brazil were more
  likely to be connected to the federal highway system. I find that, once a
  municipality is connected to the federal highway network, there is a reduction
  in informality, measured by the self-employment rate among non-agricultural,
  low-skilled workers. Moreover, I show that connected municipalities have
  higher GDP per capita, larger firms in the formal sector, and higher demand
  for formal employment. These results suggest that better transportation
  infrastructure induces the growth and development of the formal sector.
